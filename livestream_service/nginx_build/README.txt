This needs to be dockerized probably


to test the nginx configuration:
ritesh@blackmaiden:/mnt/c/Users/mkrit/Desktop/3219_project/CS3219_strawhats/livestream_service$ sudo /usr/local/nginx/sbin/nginx -t
nginx: the configuration file /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf syntax is ok
nginx: configuration file /usr/local/nginx/conf/nginx.conf test is successful
